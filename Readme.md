# Project: Prediction of Gas Consumption over 3 Months

## Overview

This project, developed by [Hella Bouhadda](https://github.com/hellabouhadda) and [Charlotte Cegarra](https://github.com/charlottecegarra), aims to create an accurate forecasting model to estimate the gas consumption of Edinburgh Airport over a three-month period. 

The objective is to provide reliable forecasts to better manage energy resources, optimize costs, and ensure a constant and adequate gas supply for the airport's operational needs.

## Objectives

The aim of this project is to develop an accurate forecasting model to estimate the gas consumption of Edinburgh Airport at 30-minute intervals over a three-month period. Given that Edinburgh Airport is currently experiencing an increase in gas prices, like the rest of the UK, it is crucial to have reliable forecasts to better manage energy resources and optimize costs.

To achieve this goal, the project focuses on the use of advanced time series forecasting techniques, such as ADL models, XGBoost, the Kalman filter, and other machine learning models. These methods will be tested and validated to ensure accuracy above 85%, which is essential for providing robust and actionable estimates.

By accurately anticipating gas consumption, the airport will be able to better plan its gas purchases, minimize waste, and potentially reduce energy expenses, while ensuring a constant and adequate supply for its operational needs.

Additionally, with forecasts at 30-minute intervals, the airport will be able to react proactively to real-time consumption changes, thereby optimizing energy efficiency and resource management.

Therefore, this project aims to provide a powerful and accurate tool for the energy management of Edinburgh Airport, contributing to more efficient resource utilization and significant cost reduction in this period of rising gas prices.
